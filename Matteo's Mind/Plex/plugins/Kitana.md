#### What is Kitana?

[](https://github.com/pannal/Kitana#what-is-kitana)

Kitana exposes your Plex plugin interfaces "to the outside world". It does that by authenticating against Plex.TV, then connecting to the Plex Media Server you tell it to, and essentially proxying the plugin UI. It has full PMS connection awareness and allows you to connect locally, remotely, or even via relay.

It does that in a responsive way, so your Plugins are easily managable from your mobile phones for example, as well.

_**Running one instance of Kitana can serve infinite amounts of servers and plugins**_ - you can even expose your Kitana instance to your friends, so they can manage their plugins as well, so they don't have to run their own Kitana instance.

Kitana was built for [Sub-Zero](https://github.com/pannal/Sub-Zero.bundle) originally, but handles other plugins just as well.
